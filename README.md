## About The Project
![image](https://github.com/Yashg2604/SafaiSaathi/blob/main/src/assets/homescreen.png)


SafaiSaathi is an app designed to streamline waste management. Developed during the AI Manthan Hackathon, hosted by IIIT-D.  

This application is focused on making waste disposal easier through classification, user guidance, and innovative features such as a fine-tuned AI chatbot and voice-enabled interactions.


## Features

- **Gemini-powered chatbot**  
  - Multilingual support for user queries.  
  - Fine-tuned for accurate and context-aware responses to waste management questions.  

- **VoiceX voice interaction system**  
  - Uses **Sarvam API** for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to convert voice input into text.  
  - Uses **Gemini** to generate natural voice responses from the ASR transcripts, enabling smooth conversational experiences.

- **Waste classification and disposal guidance**  
  - Helps users identify the correct category of waste.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" >Git</a> is a distributed version control system used for software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, keeping track of changes and managing versions. It also enables users to revert changes and collaborate more effectively.

<a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun</a> is a JavaScript runtime, package manager, test runner bundler built from scratch using the Zig programming language. It was designed by Jarred Sumner as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. Bun uses JavaScriptCore as the JavaScript engine, unlike Node.js and Deno, which both use V8.
